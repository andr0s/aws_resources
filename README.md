# List all AWS resources

List all used AWS resources, including (but not limited to!) S3 buckets, EC2 instances, Lambda functions, VPCs, etc. Over a **hundred** different resources supported.

# Why?

To monitor and delete things that aren't needed anymore - especially those that you might be paying for.

# Project status

Developed with huge use of AI tools. Code might have some bugs and/or not implemented functions. Bugfixes, tests, improvements are appreciated!
